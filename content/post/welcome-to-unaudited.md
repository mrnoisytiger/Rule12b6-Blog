Welcome to Unaudited, a blog where I talk everyone's favorite subject, Accounting, and posisbly some other stuff. 

## For the Recruiters

Felix Jen is a senior UCLA Business Economics major and Accounting minor (2015-2018), with a focus on the financial services and wealth management industry. In addition to his accounting field, he is highly skilled in data analytics and visualization using the latest statistical software packages and has a deep background in informational technology and cybersecurity. He is the senior lead systems administration in Daily Bruin, the premier on-campus news site, and is Chief Technology Officer and Chief Information Security Officer of Bruin Home Solutions, an on-campus non-profit whose mission is to bring clean and renewable energy all of the UCLA campus.

## For Everyone Else

Felix is a cool dude who occasionally has delusions of self-grandeur, mental breakdowns, and a drinking passion (not problem). You can find him looking confused in lecture, dreading his class choices, and wallowing in existential angst.

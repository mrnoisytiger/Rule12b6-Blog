On December 31st, 2019, Chinese health officials warned the World Health Organization (WHO) of a cluster of 41 cases of pneumonia caused by an unknown pathogen. This pathogen has later become to be known as COVID-19, a pandemic affecting individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide. As of the writing of this article, there are currently over 100,000 cases of COVID-19 across the United States with countless more appearing globally on a minute-by-minute basis. In an effort to stop rampant spread of COVID-19, state and local governments in the United States have moved to both quarantine possibly-affected individuals, as well as massively reduce open businesses and travel.

With these restrictions on both labor and leisure, labor forces and supply chain infrastructure have been substantially disrupted, with countless businesses being unable to meet contractual provisions previously agreed upon. Many businesses have failed to meet their shipment deadlines, loan convenants have gone unmet, services have been canceled. Such "non-performance of a contractual duty" are undoubtedly considered a "breach of contract"[^1] and may be grounds for the typical forms of relief. However, in certain situations, contracts may include a *force majeure* provision, effectively excusing non-performance if circumstances arise beyond either party's control.[^2]

## The Force Majeure Doctrice

The term "Force Majeure" is used to describe a "superior force" event.[^3] Used in the lens of contract law, "force majeure" typically excuses "a party's performance that is caused by an unforeseen, supervening event not within the control of either party."[^4] Such events include "Acts of God," changes in the governmental landscape, acts of terrorism, and similar widespread, unforeseeable events. The classes of events included in force majeure is intentionally vague,[^5] allowing “a flexible concept that permits the parties to formulate an agreement to address their unique course of dealings and industry idiosyncrasies.”[^6]
